**Live site**: [luisladino.github.io/adversarial-design-thinking](https://luisladino.github.io/adversarial-design-thinking/)

## What this is

A set of exercises adapted from human-centered design for use in adversarial testing of AI systems. They help you generate better attack ideas, document what you tried, and communicate what you found.

- **Attacker personas** — Empathy maps adapted for adversarial actors
- **Attack journey maps** — Multi-turn attack chains documented as sequences
- **Adversarial ideation** — Structured brainstorming for generating attack vectors
- **Vulnerability framing** — Norman's Gulf of Execution/Evaluation applied to AI
- **Harm-centered reporting** — Findings with both technical severity and human impact

The site also includes a **Technique Reference** with 83 adversarial techniques across 15 tactic categories, with effectiveness notes and research citations.
